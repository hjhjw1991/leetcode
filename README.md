my leetcode solutions

Using three main languages: CPP, Java, Python  

They are quite different when handling various problems.  

Basically, C/C++ is not good at creating new object(struct), while Java is not good at String manipulation.  
Python(Ruby/Javascript) is not so slow as I thought.  
C/C++ ~[0, 100]
Python ~[40, 200]
Java ~[200, 800]
